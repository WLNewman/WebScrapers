# WebScrapers
Web scraper for presidential polling data and for lyrics

My first attempts at webscrapers. Note that for lyrics
due to quirks in .title() songs/bands with apostrophes
don't work (the letter after ' gets wrongly capitalized).
This shouldn't be a problem as long as you're not searching
for /I'm Only Sleeping/ or something like that.
